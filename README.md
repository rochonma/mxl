## Overview

- [MXL Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [SDK Usage](docs/usage.md)

## Building

### Option 1 : Devcontainer build environment

This is the preferred option for development on wsl2 or native linux desktop. This method is self contained, provides a predictable build environment (through a dynamically built container) and pre-configured set of VSCode extensions defined in the devcontainer definition file.

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [DevContainer extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Install docker (inside wsl2 or native linux). Make sure the current user is part of the docker group.
   - On Ubuntu, this would be: `sudo apt install docker.io`
4. Install docker buildx.
   - On Ubuntu, this would be: `sudo apt install docker-buildx`
5. Install the [NVIDIA Container Runtime](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
6. Open the MXL source code folder using VSCode. In wsl2 this can be done by launching `code <mxl_directory>`
7. VSCode will detect that this folder contains a devcontainer definition. It will prompt you with a dialog "Reopen in dev container". Click this dialog. If the dialog does not appear, you can invoke the command: `CTRL-SHIFT-P -> Dev Containers : Reopen in container`

### Option 2: CMake with presets

_Note: the following instructions apply to Ubuntu 22.04._

1. Install all apt packages specified in the [Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
2. Install vcpkg as done in the [Dockerfile](.devcontainer/Dockerfile)
3. Create a build directory and invoke cmake with a build preset. the list of available presets is:

```bash
  "Linux-GCC-Debug"
  "Linux-GCC-Release"
  "Linux-GCC-AddressSanitizer"
  "Linux-GCC-ThreadSanitizer"
  "Linux-GCC-UBSanitizer"
  "Linux-Clang-Debug"
  "Linux-Clang-Release"
  "Linux-Clang-AddressSanitizer"
  "Linux-Clang-UBSanitizer"
  "Darwin-Clang-Debug"
  "Darwin-Clang-Release"
  "Darwin-Clang-AddressSanitizer"
  "Darwin-Clang-UBSanitizer"
```

For example:

```bash
# Generate the build files using the Linux-Clang-Debug preset
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. --preset Linux-Clang-Debug

# Build everything
cmake --build build/Linux-Clang-Debug --target all
```

### macOS notes

1. Install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager
2. Install doxygen and ccache through brew: `brew install doxygen ccache`
3. Install the GStreamer runtime and developement packages according to [these instructions](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/on-mac-osx.html?gi-language=c#download-and-install-the-sdk)

### macOS notes

## Using with CMake

The MXL provides a CMake package configuration file that allows for easy integration into your project. If it is installed in a non-default location, you may need to specify its root path using `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/username/mxl-sdk ..
```

### Basic usage

Below is a minimal example of how to use the MXL in your project:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(mxl-test LANGUAGES CXX)
find_package(mxl CONFIG REQUIRED)
add_executable(mxl-test main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(mxl-test PRIVATE mxl::mxl)
```

## Automated Testing

This project use [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) automated testing framework. This framework is a modern, lightweight, compatible with CMake/CTest and nicely integrated with VSCode [C++ Test Mate](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matepek.vscode-catch2-test-adapter) extension.

## Documentation

Documentation is automatically generated by Doxygen. A documentation target is available in the cmake generate build files.

`ninja doc`

## Logging

This library uses [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for internal logging. Logging is disabled by default but can be enabled by setting the MXL_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to one of : off, critical, error, warn, info, debug, trace.
At the moment the logs are going to stdout.

_Note: the debug and trace log statements are statically excluded from the library at compilation time in release mode._

## Tools

### mxl-info

Simple tool that uses the MXL sdk to open a flow by ID and prints the flow details.

```bash
Usage: ./mxl-info [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  --version                   Display program version information and exit
  -d,--domain TEXT:DIR REQUIRED
                              The MXL domain directory
  -f,--flow TEXT              The flow id to analyse
  -l,--list                   List all flows in the MXL domain
```

Example 1 : listing all flows in a domain

```bash
./mxl-info -d ~/mxl_domain/ -l
--- MXL Flows ---
        5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed

```

Example 2 : Printing details about a specific flow

```bash
./mxl-info -d ~/mxl_domain/ -f 5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed

- Flow [5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed]
        version           : 1
        struct size       : 4192
        flags             : 0x00000000000000000000000000000000
        head index        : 52146817788
        grain rate        : 60000/1001
        grain count       : 3
        last write time   : 2025-02-19 11:44:12 UTC +062314246ns
        last read time    : 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC +000000000ns
```

Hint : Live monitoring of a flow details (updates every second)

```bash
watch -n 1 -p ./mxl-info -d ~/mxl_domain/ -f 5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed
```

### mxl-viewer

TODO. A generic GUI application based on gstreamer or ffmpeg to display flow(s).
