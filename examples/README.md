# Docker Compose Example
This examples launches a total of 6 containers, 3 for video, 3 for audio.

```
mxl-example-audio-flow-writer
mxl-example-video-flow-writer
```
These run the `mxl-gst-testsrc` tool provided in the repository to publish a testsignal.

```
mxl-example-audio-fake-reader
mxl-example-video-fake-reader
```
These simulate side effects of a reader consuming the respective flows, such as updating the `Last read time` of discrete flows.

```
mxl-example-audio-flow-info
mxl-example-video-flow-info
```

These print out information about the video and audio flow to stdout.
You can check the output and observe if everything is working correctly by running:
```bash
docker logs mxl-example-video-flow-info-1
```

You can also bind the mxl domain created as part of the docker compose deployment to a local mountpoint using a script provided in the `scripts` directory.
```bash
scripts/bind-compose-domain.sh ./mxl-domain
```

You can then preview the flows published by the containerized media functions in your host environment:
```bash
# show video flow
mxl-gst-sink -d ./mxl-domain -v 5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed

# play audio flow
mxl-gst-sink -d ./local-domain -a b3bb5be7-9fe9-4324-a5bb-4c70e1084449
```

> **NOTE:** Out of the box, the setup works correctly only with docker.io. When using Docker CE, `docker compose up` may fail with:
>
> ```
> invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: /dev/shm/mxl

## Building

In the "examples" directory run:

```bash
docker compose build
```
## Running

In the "examples" directory run: 
```bash
docker compose up
```
or to start in the background:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Kubernetes Example

Note: Tested on K3S and Kubernetes created with `kubeadm`. This will probably not run on more restrictive Kubernetes distributions like Openshift or Rancher.

Follow the same steps above to build the images. If you don't want to use a registry to access the images from the kubernetes cluster, you can export the images to a file and import them on your kubernetes cluster node.
On the system where your built the images:
```bash
scripts/export-images.sh mxl-example-images.tar.gz
```
On the kubernetes node (when using containerd):
```bash
gunzip < mxl-example-images.tar.gz | sudo ctr image import -
```

If you want to use a registry, you will need to change the image references in `kube-example.yaml` to point to the images in your registry.
```bash
sed -i 's%docker.io/library/%images.mycompany.com/repos/%g'
```

Because PersistentVolumes requires a `nodeAffinity` clause you also need to inject the hostname of the node you want to run the example containers on into the deployment.
You can use the provided script.
```bash
scripts/render-kube-template.sh my-node-hostname > /tmp/deployment.yml
```

You can then deploy the resources with:
```bash
kubectl apply -r /tmp/deployment.yml
```

To check the pods that are running use this command:

``` bash
kubectl get pod -w
```

To check if the video flow writer is producing frames:
```bash
kubectl logs -f mxl-video-flow-info-(...)
```

To check if the audio flow writer is producing samples:
```bash
kubectl logs -f mxl-audio-flow-info-(...)
```
