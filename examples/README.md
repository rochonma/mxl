# Docker Compose Example

This example launches two containers simulating two different media functions executing in separate containers.  It relies on docker.io and docker-compose-plugin being installed on the host.

- Writer container: The docker volume named "domain" is mounted in read-write mode in the writer media function container.  The writer process generates a test pattern with burnt in time of day.
- Reader container: The docker volume named "domain" is mounted in read-only mode in the reader media function. At the moment the reader media function container is idling.  To use it you need to exec into it: 

    ```bash
    docker exec -it examples-reader-media-function-1 /app/mxl-info -d /domain -f 5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed
    ```

## Building 

Compile the whole MXL library and tools using the ```Linux-Clang-Release``` preset by invoking ```ninja all``` in the ```build/Linux-Clang-Release```  directory.  Then, in the "examples" directory, run:

```bash
docker compose build
```

## Running

In the "examples" directory run:

```bash
docker compose up
```


# Kubernetes Example
    Note: Tested on Docker Desktop Environment which as the correct default storageclass "HostPath" which has a host path provisioner. Therefore its unlikely to work in managed k8s environments without changes

Follow the same steps above to build the container images and then run this command to deploy the kubernetes resources
``` bash
kubectl create -f kube-deployment.yaml
```

To check the pods are running use this command, once both the reader and writer are running, grab the name name of the reader pod
``` bash
kubectl get pod -w
```

Now execute the following command

``` bash
kubectl exec -it <reader-pod-name> -- /app/mxl-info -d /domain -f 5fbec3b1-1b0f-417d-9059-8b94a47197ed
```
